<h2>what is the databae?</h2>
<p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).
 Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series
 of tables to make processing and data querying efficient.
 The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. 
 Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.</p>
<p>SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to
 provide access control. 
SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL
 ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. 
Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.
